#   Write a function is_prime(n) that returns True if n is a prime number and false otherwise, using a loop.

# Hint -
# 1. We only check prime for 2 or numbers greater than 2. 2 is the smallest
# prime number.
# 2. non-Prime number, n, will always get divided by atleast one number in range [2, n-1].
# Eg - For number 9 we’ll check in range (2, 8) & it’ll get divided by 3. So 9 is
# non-prime & we’ll return false for it.
# For number 7 we’ll check in range (2, 6) & it won’t get divided by any. So 7 is prime & we’ll return true for it.
